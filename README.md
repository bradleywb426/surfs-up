# An Analysis of Surf Shop Viability in Oahu

## Resources

- Data: hawaii.sqlite

- Software: Python 3.10.5

## Overview

To understand the viability of a combination Surf Shop and Ice Cream store as a year-round source of income, 
W. Avy has asked for a summary of the temperatures for the months of June and December over the entire range of data.

## Results

**Summary Statistics and Histogram of Temperature for the month of June**

---------------

- June has an average temperature of about 75 degrees Farenheit, which is 4 degrees higher than the average temperature for December of about 71 degrees Farenheit.
  - Both months, however, have a majority of temperatures over 70 degrees Farenheit.

- June has a normal distribtution of temperatures between throughout its range, with a majority happening around the average, while December has a very significant frequency of temperatures at the average. 
  - Temperatures around December's average happen at a much lower frequency, which remains relatively consistent in a 5 degree range above and below December's average. 

- June has a range of temperature of 21 degrees Farenheit, ranging from 64 degrees Farenheit to 85 degrees Farenheit. December has a some more variation in temperatures with a range of 27 degrees Farenheit, ranging from 56 degrees Farenheit (notably lower than June's minimum) to 83 degrees Farenheit (which is ver clsoe to June's maximum).

## Summary

Based on the above results, W. Avy's Surf and Ice Cream Shop is viable year round. The average temperature is relatively constistent between the hottest and coldest months, and the temperature are most frequently in the 70s or greater. Further questions that could be explored to further support this claim are:

- The frequency of different weather types in the region, and how much (if any) precipitation occured over the course of the month.
  - For example, if December is warm but typically overcast and or rainy, customers would likely be far less inclined to surf or get ice cream, which is bad for business.

- The temperatures (and weather types/precipitation) of other months.
  - For example, months in other seasons could be far less desirable for a Surf and Ice Cream shop, which forces W. Avy to rely on two main seasons for business. This would likely require a major replanning of his business plan at a minimum.
